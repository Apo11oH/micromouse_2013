Folders:
	"motorControl test" => contains the program that is currently on the Maple
	"motorControl2" => contains the program the is currently being worked on
						a.k.a. bleeding edge version (might be broken at times)
	"motorControl" => the very first code that was written that is being left 
						for posterity's sake
	
IDE:
	"maple-ide-0.0.12-blahblah" 
		has all the libraries setup for the project. can be used without any 
		installation
		
Other:
	-Docs and Spreadsheet should be self-explanatory.
	-"libpololu-avr-*.exe" is the Pololu AVR library installer
	-Other folders and files have to do with the Maple drivers for Windows but
	it's all messed up and should be cleaned up sometime in the future.
